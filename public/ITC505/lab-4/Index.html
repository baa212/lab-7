<h1><b>Strategic Business Plan Prepared to Fulfill Consulting Duties in Service of Tesla</b></h1>
<article>
    <h2><b>Executive Summary</b></h2>
    <p> 
        Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the world, and with that comes challenges that are critical to its development. Tesla currently faces many issues, both externally and internally, so improving the company is essential to its growth and risk reduction. One such issue that Tesla faces is how environmentally friendly Tesla is in procuring and recycling the materials needed for their vehicles. Tesla buys lithium for their batteries, however, traditional lithium mining is harmful to the environment, thus there are better alternatives. Although Tesla has made their batteries recyclable, they have no control over whether the materials from their vehicles are being properly recycled. Tesla should consider buying or merging with an existing company to effectively recycle the material used in their batteries. These are some of the ways Tesla can follow their mission statement more accurately by becoming more eco-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla is currently buying and moving their materials all over the world through the use of shipping containers. This method of shipping can be harmful to the environment, thus new alternatives for container material and transportation should be considered, like developing ships that utilize different methods of power. One of its biggest markets and suppliers is China, so international transportation is necessary to produce revenue. Although it is a great source of revenue, Tesla should not be too dependent on another country for its products; rather it should, either have more suppliers or use vertical integration to streamline production. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla has also taken a hit to their reputation since they are involved in lawsuits regarding discrimination and are unable to uphold their promises. Tesla has been regarded as having an unethical and harmful work environment as seen by lawsuits for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for discriminating against African-American employees. They can help solve or reduce this issue by implementing an ethics board and work training programs to help reduce harassment and provide a safe environment for employees. Tesla has made promises that their vehicles have self-driving features when you buy them. However, to this day there are thousands of recalls for vehicle malfunctions which not only hurts Tesla's reputation but also poses safety risks. Tesla should not make huge promises to others that they are unable to fulfill and compensate those who were let down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla also has an issue with their vehicles in cold environments as they were originally produced and created in California. Tesla should focus on making batteries and vehicles that can handle different climates for different states. This not only expands Tesla’s market, but it allows its current drivers to travel to areas that are otherwise not fit for a Tesla vehicle. Tesla is also facing problems with selling their vehicles in different states due to laws that prevent Tesla from selling their products directly to the customer and their lack of charging stations across the country. The minimal charging stations detract customers from wanting to buy their vehicles as they are not fit for long-distance traveling. Overall, Tesla needs to redesign and improve their car parts, continue to fight against state laws that impact their business transactions, and expand the number of charging stations locations.

    <h2><b>Environmentally Friendliness</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla introduced their first electric car in 2008, bringing attention to the alternative ways a car can be designed and powered. As the years passed, Tesla built their company with the mission of “[accelerating] the world’s transition to sustainable energy. In pursuit of this goal [Tesla builds] products that are designed to replace some of the planet’s biggest polluters – while trying to do the right thing along the way” (Tesla). Although they have been able to follow through on their mission statement, some areas can be improved. Tesla has been portrayed as a very sustainable and environmentally friendly brand, so while they are more environmentally friendly than most companies, there are still a few ways they can improve their lithium mining, recycling, and transportation methods.
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2><b>Lithium Mining</b></h2>
    <p>
        As an electric car manufacturer, one of the parts Tesla buys from a supplier is the lithium used in their batteries. However, mining for lithium is not as environmentally friendly as Tesla would have consumers believe. Mining for lithium requires miners to “drill a hole in the salt flats and pump salty, mineral-rich brine to the surface. After several months the water evaporates, leaving a mixture of manganese, potassium, borax, and lithium salts” (Institute for Energy Research). From there the mixture is placed in another evaporation pool for twelve to eighteen months, from which lithium carbonate is extracted. Lithium is mostly “extracted from hard rock mines or underground brine reservoirs, and much of the energy used to extract and process it comes from CO2-emitting fossil fuels” (MIT Climate). With the emission of fossil fuels, Tesla is not following their mission statement and should focus on using alternatives. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only is the mining process harmful by emitting fossil fuels, but it also has a large impact on the water supply of surrounding areas. More than half of the lithium supply can also be found in the driest areas in the world. For example, in Chile’s Salar de Atacama, “mining activities consumed 65 percent of the region’s water, which is having a large impact on local farmers to the point that some communities have to get water elsewhere” (Institute for Energy Research). Water sources are not only drained but have also been contaminated in some areas as seen in “May 2016, [when] dead fish were found in the waters of the Liqi River, where a toxic chemical leaked from the Ganzizhou Rongda Lithium mine…It was the third incident in seven years…” (Institute for Energy Research). Despite these negative impacts on the environment, Tesla continues to use these harmful tactics which shows that there is a weakness between what Tesla is promising to fulfill and what is being done. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since lithium mining will eventually make it to the United States as it “has great potential for lithium extraction, careful consideration must be taken to avoid and limit negative impacts on water sources and biodiversity and to consider the needs of local communities” (The Nature Conservancy). Some alternative methods to reduce the harmful impact on the environment are forms of direct extraction such as ion exchange, lithium bonding (absorption), and solvent extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Direct extraction methods “efficiently extract lithium from brines or other sources, reducing water consumption, carbon footprint, and overall ecosystem impact” (Lithium Harvest). These new methods of extraction utilize technology that reduces the extraction time to a few hours rather than the traditional method which takes up to a year.  Along with the benefit of a smaller extraction time and impact on the environment these new methods “can be integrated with existing infrastructure, like geothermal power plants or oil field brine recovery systems, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental disturbance” (Lithium Harvest). These methods emit about half of the emissions that are released when the traditional method of lithium mining is used. Switching to one of these methods would be a great opportunity for Tesla to grow the market for these alternatives while also becoming more environmentally friendly. If Tesla can partner with a company using one of these methods before it is mainstream, it would enable them to build a partnership for a smaller cost, while also helping the smaller company and helping the new industry grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ion exchange method involves switching lithium ions for similar ions within the rock mines or brine reservoirs. The ion exchange process “requires an acid solution for stripping and recovering the lithium” (Lithium Harvest). This means that the acid solution is used to separate the ions through a physicochemical process in which the lithium ions are traded for ions with the same charge (Jurado). This process is beneficial because “there is a high concentration of lithium in the solution and the impurity contamination risk is minimized” (International Battery Metals). Another benefit of this method is that researchers believe they can recover about 90% of the lithium that is being mined (Jurado). While this process uses acid, this method is still more environmentally friendly than the current method used to extract lithium.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lithium bonding, also known as absorption, is another method that can also be used to mine for lithium. This method uses “sorbents to physically adhere to the lithium for selective removal” (Jurado), meaning those who are mining are able to use chloride to bond with the lithium ions to produce lithium chloride. From there, the lithium is separated from the solution and becomes pure lithium that can be utilized in the batteries. As described, “this method doesn’t require an acid wash or other chemicals” (Jurado), this difference between methods makes absorption the most environmentally friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another method that could be used is the solvent exchange method. This method “relies on exchanging lithium ions between brine and an organized liquid phase” (Lithium Harvest). This process exchanges the lithium by “capturing lithium either chemically or physically and transforming it into LiCl or Li* from brine” (Jurado). Like other direct methods that can be used to mine for lithium, high concentrations of lithium are produced from the brine. However with this method, “the organic solvents are environmentally challenging and it only works with low concentrations of calcium and magnesium” (International Battery Metals). When looking for an alternative Tesla would need to weigh the pros of “selectively extracting lithium from complex brines while maintaining high purity levels” (Lithium Harvest) against the cons of there being “fire risks with the high-temperature brines and this technology is relevantly expensive” (International Battery Metals). 
    </p>
    <p>
        These three alternatives would be more beneficial for the environment, are less time-consuming, and have a lower cost than the traditional method used. Although the lithium bonding method is the most beneficial Tesla should consider contracting with lithium mining companies that utilize one of the three alternative methods. This would ensure that they are adhering to their mission statement by reducing their carbon footprint and helping society move towards a more sustainable future. These alternatives give Tesla the opportunity to maintain a high relative market share and help the market grow; moving them from their current status on the MCG’s matrix as a cash cow into a star. If Tesla does not seize this opportunity, in the future, Tesla will face the threat of other more environmentally friendly companies that are able to produce electric cars in a more timely and cheaper manner. This can ultimately lead to Tesla losing its market share, as consumers move to companies utilizing methods that reduce the harm inflicted on the environment. In losing their market share, Tesla would quickly become a question mark, that would turn into a dog if they do not adapt to the changes in the industry before other companies enter the market.

    <h2><b>Battery Recycling</b></h2>
    <p>
        Currently, the batteries used in electric vehicles “are refined and put into a cell, and will still remain in the cell at the end of their life, when they can be recycled to recover its valuable materials for reuse over and over again” (Tesla). Tesla does everything it can to extend the lifespan of each battery, before ultimately sending it off to be recycled. While this has largely benefited our atmosphere and follows Tesla’s mission statement, there are a few issues that were not originally accounted for. Tesla has been able to improve how much of the battery can be recycled, but “it currently only sees a few battery packs from consumer vehicles coming back” (Lambert). This reduces the impact of recycling the batteries because while they might be able to improve on how much of the battery can be recycled if no one is utilizing the proper way of recycling them, the batteries could end up in landfills and other areas that can be negatively impacted. Research shows that as “a conductor, lithium is unstable in uncontrolled environments, and can cause landfill fires that emit toxic gasses into the atmosphere” (Carleton). To improve the amount of batteries that are recycled, Tesla should put a clause in their purchase agreement requiring the consumer to either bring the car to a Tesla facility or call for Tesla to come pick up the battery to have it recycled. Another solution might be for Tesla to buy the battery from the consumer to incentivize the consumer to bring back the battery. This would not only reduce the number of batteries that could be found in landfills, but this would also increase the number of materials Tesla can reuse. Earthworks reported that “battery recycling could cut down on the amount of new mineral mining needed across the industry by 25% for lithium, 35% for cobalt and nickel, and 55% for copper by 2040” (Carleton). This would allow Tesla to cut down on the costs needed to produce more batteries, while also improving the environment. Tesla should enact both of these solutions to minimize the number of batteries that are not being returned. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since Tesla works “with third-party recyclers [meaning] Tesla likely does not retain much control over what happens to the minerals in their batteries once they’re sent to a recycler” (Carleton). Even if Tesla works with a recycling company that properly recycles, “manufacturers are secretive about what goes into their batteries, [making] them harder to recycle properly” (Institute for Energy Research). To ensure that the recyclization of the batteries is as environmentally friendly as possible, Tesla should acquire or merge with a recycling company. It would be more beneficial for Tesla to acquire a recycling company as they would be able to set up the policies and procedures that fit with Tesla’s mission statement. Merging with a company would most likely lead to Tesla giving up some of its values and standards when addressing environmental impact concerns. By acquiring a battery recycling company, Tesla would be able to share its specifications of manufacturing their battery, allowing the new recycling aspect of Tesla to find an environmentally friendly way to break down the battery while also maintaining the parts well enough to be reused. In acquiring a company, Tesla would accomplish vertical integration as they are the owners and controllers of another aspect of their current supply chain. This is an opportunity for Tesla as they would be able to implement a related diversification multiproduct strategy that can improve performance and create operational relatedness. This would give Tesla the opportunity to grow the battery recycling market. Meaning they would enter the market, becoming a question mark on the BCG’s matrix and ultimately into a star. To become a star they would need to increase the market growth rate by improving the technologies in the market to help them hold a higher relative market share.

    <h2><b>Sustainable Transportation</b></h2>
    <p>
        While Tesla is known for being an environmentally friendly company, there are still some aspects where they are not helping the environment to the best of their ability. As stated earlier there are a variety of parts that are used in creating the batteries that power Tesla’s electric cars; as well as a variety of companies and locations that are supplying the materials for these parts. For Tesla to receive these products they must be transported from all over the world. Tesla and their suppliers use shipping containers to move their products or materials to where they are needed. The research shows that they are a durable and efficient method of transportation however, “shipping accounts for approximately 2.2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Shipping containers themselves contribute to this carbon footprint, both their production and their use” (VS&B Containers Group). Although Tesla is building a battery factory in Austin, Texas so it is more self-sufficient, Tesla “is still buying batteries from other manufacturers, ‘and that won’t change this decade’” (Bowker and Krisher). Since Tesla will still utilize international travel for aspects of the production of their battery, Tesla should consider some alternatives to their current method of transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shipping containers are produced using “energy-intensive materials such as steel, which accounts for approximately 60% of the total weight of a container” and about 7% of global CO2 emissions (VS&B Containers Group). One way for Tesla to reduce some of their emissions while transporting is to purchase shipping containers that use alternative materials to steel. One alternative is to purchase their containers from companies that use “bamboo, which is a fast-growing, renewable resource, to make container floors. Bamboo is also lightweight and strong” (VS&B Containers Group). Another alternative is for Tesla to work with companies that use recycled materials to construct new containers. Those who use recycled materials have found that the containers are durable and lighter than the traditional container. Tesla should start using bamboo containers as it is a renewable resource and is seen to have the benefits associated with traditional containers.   
    </p>
    <p>
        transporting the containers contributes to emissions as most “ships use heavy fuel oil, which is high in sulfur and other pollutants and is a significant contributor to air pollution and climate change” (VS&B Containers Group). In this developing industry, there are a variety of ideas incorporated around new and improved sails. The Swedish company, Wallenius Marine, developed “a cargo ship powered by retractable wing-like sails that the company claims will be able to carry 7,000 cars and reduce emissions by 90%” (Towey). Although the current size of the vessel would not hold enough cars to fully support Tesla, it would help reduce the amount of emissions Tesla contributes to transportation and provide the company with the necessary funds and support to expand on their idea. Another alternative would be a ship built by Veer, “a ship-builder aiming to have two 100% emissions-free container ships on the water by the end of 2024” that is currently in development (Towey). This ship “recently received an ‘approval in principal’ from the American Bureau of Shipping, a classification that confirms the engineering behind untested technological concepts” (Towey). Unlike the ship that uses retractable wings, this vessel “uses DynaRig sail technology and green hydrogen fuel cell engines to optimize transit times” (Towey). There are a variety of alternatives Tesla can use to minimize their impact on the environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For Tesla to follow through on their mission statement to expedite the transition to sustainable energy, it should begin using bamboo containers and partner with Wallenius Marine in order to develop a boat that can carry more vehicles than its current capacity. Doing so not only improves the environment, but it showcases to other companies that they can make a profit while also helping the environment. This would strengthen Tesla as they could eventually vertically integrate the transportation company through an acquisition or merger. 
    </p>

    <h2><b>Globalization Risks</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla being one of the biggest companies in the world, utilizes globalization to enter markets and gain suppliers from different countries. However, Tesla relies too much on one country to help support its company instead of diversifying their business to reduce risk.
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2><b>Overreliance</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla currently has a strong dependence on China and its demand. For example, “...one-third of Tesla's global volume in the first half of 2023 was delivered to China” (Munoz). This makes Tesla one of the biggest Western companies in the world that is most exposed to Chinese demand and because of this exposure, it has a heavy reliance on them in turn. This can be “...positive in times of peace, but can become a curse in the event of a potential trade/political conflict between China and the US/Europe” (Munoz). This can lead to a major issue due to their over-reliance on one market and because of the Ukraine-Russian war, chances for conflicts between the US/Europe and Russia and China increase. China could end up punishing Tesla for its conflicts with Western countries. Due to Tesla being so heavily reliant on China, the growth of Chinese car brands will also affect them negatively. For example, “There are more than 170 local brands, many of which cater to segments similar to Tesla” (Munoz). Tesla has too much risk by relying on external influences like China’s markets. For instance, if China decided to cut off Tesla from its market because it wanted to focus on its own domestic car companies, then Tesla would take a massive hit due to having over one-third of their market closed to it. Tesla would have a massive surplus of cars that they would have to try and sell elsewhere in other markets in different countries. Another issue with their over-reliance on external resources like Chinese supply and demand is that their profits would suffer massively, resulting in Tesla shutting down factories and laying off workers if China blocks Tesla from their market. They would no longer be able to sell to one of their biggest markets. Tesla’s dependence on China will hurt their business if they are not more careful because of these potential risks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla is also too dependent on one country and one automobile market when it comes to getting supplies for their products and outsourcing. For instance, “Tesla relies on China as a supplier, but also as a market for its top-selling EVs. It sells about 40 percent of its new cars in the country” (Halper). The chance of not being able to sell to China would be crippling to Tesla, both for their inability to sell their vehicles there and to make their vehicles. One of the biggest suppliers of lithium batteries and other parts that Tesla uses to make their cars is a Chinese company. For example, “CATL’s products power hundreds of thousands of Tesla’s assembled in both China and North America” (Halper). Having only one major supplier to rely on makes Tesla vulnerable because the supplier, CATL, holds a lot of sway over the company due to Tesla’s reliance on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A solution for this issue Tesla faces is to diversify more in what markets they sell in and the suppliers they use. This might end up costing more money for them than if they just used a Chinese supplier and only had to worry about selling their products in a Chinese market. However, it would also mean they would have less risk if they had a larger market segment and more suppliers to count on. Having Tesla rely less on China and outsourcing to them, will prove positive and beneficial not only for the company but for economies like the United States. For instance, “The $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed by President Joe Biden in August aims to wean U.S. EV production from Chinese supply chains by imposing new conditions on EV tax credit” (Shepardson). This credit would only be usable in North American-made vehicles and battery sourcing. This shows how important it is for the U.S. economy to have automobile companies rely less on outsourcing and supply chains in other countries like China. 
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2><b>Outsourcing</b></h2>
    <p>
        Outsourcing to multiple companies and diversifying is beneficial in the long run because it reduces the reliance Tesla has on one main supplier, it will also increase flexibility for the company because Tesla will be able to distribute tasks across several suppliers. Doing this will help Tesla “...tap into a diverse set of capabilities and expertise” (Reid). Outsourcing to multiple companies will also lead to competitive pricing as providers will be more willing to offer better rates and provide incentives to keep Tesla’s business which will end up reducing costs. Overall, outsourcing can be beneficial but to help mitigate risks, Tesla should have multiple companies as large suppliers of their products and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another possible solution for Tesla is to lower the amount of outsourcing it does by, using vertical integration and creating a personal supply chain to make the materials needed for its vehicles and products. Other companies are already starting to do this to stop their over-reliance on one country and market. For instance, Ford Motors, an automobile company like Tesla, has recently announced that instead of using technology from the Chinese company CATL, the same supplier Tesla uses, they will build a battery plant in Michigan. This is because, as Ford Motors mentions, “...making those batteries here at home is much better than continuing to rely exclusively on foreign imports like other auto companies do” (Shepardson). This solution will reduce the risks involved with Tesla relying on another company to supply their materials and would help Tesla internally because it would be able to make its supplies whenever it needs them. This is beneficial in the long run because if Tesla starts to make their cars more than it outsources the production of it there will be less risk of lower work quality in their products, no need to share information with another company, and it will lower the chances of miscommunication from the different companies involved in the production of their products. Tesla reducing their outsourcing to China is also better and more effective for long-term goals because it is more strategic than tactical in orientation. Suppose Tesla does not change their supplier or start producing their own materials. In that case, this will lead to threats in the future and a wasted opportunity by Tesla because other car companies have already started the process of building their plants and factories. This will help reduce the reliance on foreign imports that Tesla has and thus reduce the risk of failure or mishaps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the tension between the U.S. and China, the chances of China cutting off Tesla, an American company, from its suppliers or its market due to the large amount of control it has over its domestic companies and market is high. Thus this can prove harmful and impactful to Tesla on a global scale because the company relies heavily on supplies and materials from China. These are the reasons why Tesla should implement these solutions into their company to lower the amount of risk it would face both internally and externally.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Legal Issues</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla, a company often lauded for its innovation and forward-thinking approach, has found itself in the crosshairs of criticism due to several ongoing legal issues and unfulfilled promises. This section will delve deeper into the lawsuits Tesla is currently facing, particularly highlighting the significant case of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) V Tesla, and will then explore the implications of the company's self-driving features and delays in delivering vehicles to their customers.

    <h2><b>Tesla’s Workplace Environment</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla’s work conditions have been stated to be less than ideal for workers due to its harmful and unhealthy environment. There have been several issues regarding Tesla’s workplace environment and its involvement in harassment and retaliation for those who speak out against it. For instance, “Tesla, Inc., violated federal law by tolerating widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees” (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). As well as “…subjecting some of these workers to retaliation for opposing the harassment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit filed” (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). According to the EEOC, this problem has been ongoing since around 2015 until now, which suggests that this issue has not been dealt with effectively or at all by Tesla leaders. Ethical climates and an organizational culture start from the top, so for something like this to happen, leaders of the company must not be enforcing a healthy culture or punishing those who violate their code of ethics. This is an internal issue because having a healthy and ethical organizational culture is important since it is the backbone of a company, and Tesla is no exception. This also affects the external environment because being known to have an unethical work culture will and has affected Tesla’s reputation which is an important part of any company.
    </p>
    <p>
        The EEOC’s investigation into this issue found that “...those who raised objections to the harassment suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions” (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). Tesla has been involved in allowing an unlawful and hostile work environment to exist and is punishing those who speak out against these issues, not those who have caused them or perpetuated them in the company. This reflects poorly on Tesla because it damages its reputation. Tesla having their reputation affected by this makes it more difficult to attract and keep talent because no one wants to work for a company that has hostile and unethical work environments. Competitors of Tesla can also use this weakness to increase their reputations with the public and employees just by being compared to Tesla. This makes it easier for other automobile companies to attract employees and customers as well which is why Tesla’s unethical work climate needs to be changed and held to a higher standard. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The workplace environment has left much to be desired. For example, a podcast titled “Land of the Giants: The Tesla Shock Wave” mentioned how “…Tesla's work culture led to many problems for the employees like extremely long hours, unsafe working conditions, harassment, scandals, fines, lawsuits, and even the slightest of mistake could lead to termination” (Gupta). This demonstrates how harmful the workplace environment is at Tesla and how hostile it is, posing a big problem for not only Tesla but for its stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        One possible solution to these problems is for Tesla to implement workplace training to prevent harassment from occurring. As OSHA states, “...the solution to dealing with harassment in the workplace is education, not litigation” (OSHA). Having workplace harassment prevention training will not only help reduce incidents but also provide a defense for Tesla when it is charged with an employment-related incident. For instance, “...this training can save you time, money, and legal troubles. It can even afford an affirmative defense for employers” (OSHA).  Preventing the problem in the first place is better than stopping it once it occurs. As stated by OSHA, “Prevention is the best mechanism for eliminating complaints about possible wrongdoing, including workplace harassment and discrimination” (OSHA). Having employees of Tesla learn about harassment, how to respond to it, and understand their role in preventing it, will encourage a welcoming environment that can help reduce harassment and help present a legal defense for the company if it does occur. The training should also involve how strong-arming or retaliating against those who speak out against harassment is wrong and should not be encouraged because it is a form of harassment itself. This is one way to reduce harassment and help improve the workplace environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another solution to improve the environment of Tesla for its employees and stakeholders is to give more power to the HR department and/or develop internal controls for the company, like an ethics board. For example, the Harvard Business Review states that one way to reduce misbehavior is for companies to “...create an ethics committee of the board” (Bagley). Creating an ethical climate starts from the top, so to help fix the working environment at Tesla, they should have a committee of people with the power and responsibility for “…the firm’s culture of integrity and for creating a robust program of controls and processes to promote ethical conduct and compliance” (Bagley). This can help ensure safer working conditions and working hours for employees as well as lockdown on harassment in the company. The committee would work with the management team and board members to ensure Tesla’s “...approach to worker safety, environmental stewardship, sustainability, compliance, and corporate social responsibility is an integral part of its overall business strategy” (Bagley). Creating a committee and giving it the power to enforce good business ethics into the company will help improve Tesla’s workplace environment and reduce harassment which would be a good step in the right direction for improving the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        One final solution is to have weekly meetings with the Tesla corporate-level and business-level general managers about discrimination. These specific meetings will provide insight into the types of discrimination and the best way to address different situations if they arise. Once given the necessary tools and support, the general managers should hold weekly meetings with the functional managers as well as the frontline employees. These meetings will discuss any issues related to the discrimination of employees and will provide a safe space to talk about any instances in particular. For those who do not feel comfortable sharing with the group as a whole, an email will be sent to all employees for them to give anonymous feedback to Tesla.  This will help Tesla’s employees feel heard and valued by giving them a safe place to speak out about past issues and bring attention to current issues. If problems do arise with any employee, no matter their position in the company, they will have to attend a mandatory meeting with their supervisor and be placed on a three-month probationary period. If the behavior continues during the probationary period, the individual should be terminated. Another solution would be to form a committee, made up of one employee from every level of the organization in that location, with a maximum of ten employees. This would not only show the public that Tesla cares about their employees but also that it wants to prevent future instances. This can help reduce discrimination and build trust between the company and its employees. Tesla should implement both the meetings and the committee to improve its public reputation. With a damaged reputation, companies can fall from being cash cows to dogs as people express their disappointment in company actions.

    <h2><b>Self-Driving Issues</b></h2>
    <p>
        Another lawsuit Tesla is facing is due to their self-driving features. In April 2019, Elon Musk promised investors that Tesla cars would be fully self-driving and drivers would be able to sleep in the car (Washington Post tech). As of today, there have been recalls on thousands of Teslas that have been reported to malfunction while the car had been in self-driving mode. Based on Musk’s promise, investors have invested thousands of dollars to make what was considered impossible, possible. However, Tesla’s cars are now the cause of multiple safety risks. In one instance, a Tesla Model S “[changed] lanes and then abruptly [braked] in the far-left lane of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, resulting in an eight-vehicle crash. The crash injured nine people, including a 2-year-old child, and blocked traffic on the bridge for over an hour” (The Intercept). This accident demonstrates how Tesla should have ensured that their product strives for continuous improvement even if it may be known that the self-driving feature uses new technology. Tesla should implement total quality management in their factories to improve the quality of their products and reduce the dangers of using their products. Without continuous improvement, before the product is put on the market, Tesla will continue to face repercussions for their faults in the products. This can cause fewer consumers to purchase Tesla’s products as they are seen as unsafe and unreliable. This is a weakness in the company as consumers will purchase cars from other companies even if they are not electric. Consumers will then become faced with the decision of whether to help the environment or ensure that they and their passengers are safe. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With the evidence that has been collected during the course of this lawsuit, Tesla needs to have solutions to mitigate the damage. A potential solution would be for Tesla to remove or disable the self-driving feature on all of their vehicles and give those who purchased the feature their money back with the promise to improve it. Although this will cost money, it is an ethical decision that gives Tesla the opportunity to show consumers that they care about fixing their issues and ensuring the safety of their consumers. Another potential solution is to test the self-driving feature extensively using total quality management to ensure the best product. Tesla should only provide the ability to use the self-driving feature to certain customers who are willing to sign a waiver stating that while there may be problems with the feature they will not sue Tesla if something goes wrong. This would prevent Tesla from facing external threats from consumers and also from their competitors being publicly informed about the faults in their products.

    <h2><b>Self-Driving Issues</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla has made several promises regarding the capabilities of their future cars. In 2017, Elon Musk announced the Tesla Semi, which was said to be completed by 2019, and the Tesla Roadster which was said to be completed in 2020. Elon Musk pushed the delivery date of the Tesla Semi in order to have “500 miles of range and a class-leading 0-60 time with a full load” (Road Track One). Currently, the higher range a Tesla car has is 405 miles, making this a great selling point if achieved. On the other hand, the Tesla Roadster’s “preorders opened back in 2017, requiring a $50,000 deposit to hold your place in line…If you want a Founders Series, you have to pay the full $250,000 price tag up front, or refer a bunch of other people to buy Teslas” (Road Track). Similarly to the Tesla Semi, the Tesla Roadster has yet to be released and its production has been delayed to 2024. Since these two promises were made over six years ago, and have yet to be fulfilled, Tesla’s reputation is becoming more unreliable and consumers are beginning to view Tesla as a company known for overestimating their abilities. This can create external threats because if competitors realize that consumers will no longer purchase electriccanTesla, they are able to bring some of those customers back to their products. Not only that but this behavior can cause Tesla to become a dog on the BCG matrix once competitors move into the electric car industry. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are multiple solutions Tesla can take as a company. For example, Elon Musk can look at where his company is and where he wants the company to be in the future. It is important to take into consideration both perspectives because you can’t make huge promises looking into the future, they need to be more reasonable about where they are at as a company now. One strategy Musk can implement here is to undersell when the product will be completed. Musk can make the time frame longer to give his employees and the company time to work through any issues they may not account for. This would also allow Tesla to improve their reputation because they are finishing their projects earlier than they had anticipated. If Musk looks too much into the future and ignores what their limits are now, Tesla will continue to follow this trend of unfulfilled promises.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another solution would be to focus on one big product idea instead of having to allocate resources to multiple. The semi and roadster are examples of where this solution would have helped Tesla fulfill the promises they have made in the past. Elon Musk can focus on the operations and problems that may impact one product rather than having to face problems with multiple products. By focusing on one product, the extended time past the promised dates would be reduced and Tesla would not need to continuously give explanations for why their products are not fully developed. This would improve Tesla’s reputation for fulfilling promises while also showing that the company is aware of its strengths and limitations and is able to work within them to help the company thrive in the market.

    <h2><b>Adapting to Different Environments</b></h2>
    <p>
        Tesla is a large company, and with that comes the need for product differentiation. Tesla faces challenges because they make their vehicles a one-fits-all product in that they are more suitable to certain weathers and environments compared to others. This section will go through some of the issues Tesla faces involving their car production, how their vehicles handle colder climates, the issues in how they sell their cars across states, their growing market competition, and finally, the need for more charging stations to attract customers.
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2><b>Making Tesla More Suitable for States other than California</b></h2>
    <p>
        One other major challenge that Tesla as a company faces, is the fact that their cars are made for California and their weather, as it originated from California. The majority of California does not experience winter, the “winter” usually consists of cold nights but never gets below freezing. This is great for Tesla cars because they can work efficiently, but for others who live in states where the winters can be freezing or below freezing, it is not as convenient. Online, there have been many posts about the issue of the Tesla door handle being frozen over. The way in which you open a Tesla door, you need to be able to push one side to pop the handle out from the Tesla as the handle does not stick out from the car. If an individual lives in a freezing or below climate, their car handle is not as easily accessible as the snow can freeze over. Not only can people not enter their cars, but people have said that the defrosting period for a Tesla can take 20-30 minutes and for the battery to warm up to be able to drive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having to wait half an hour for your car to be able to drive, can be seen as inconvenient to people when in comparison they could just have another type of car that can pre-heat within ten minutes and not have to worry about the door handle. The issue of the door handle, the car defrosting, and the battery warming up seem to be internal weaknesses of Tesla. These weaknesses of Tesla can also be exploited by other companies that are getting involved in the electric car industry; they are learning from Tesla’s mistakes and improving their vehicles based on the internal weaknesses that Tesla has.
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2><b>The Effect of Tesla Battery in Cold Climates</b></h2>
    <p>
        Following, an article talked about the issues that come with owning a Tesla in colder climates. The use of the battery not only takes time to heat up to be able to drive, but the battery itself also loses driving range when temperatures plummet. “A 2019 study by AAA found the driving range [in a Tesla] plummets up to 41% on average when the temperature drops to 20 degrees and the heater is on” (Breda). Tesla has said to solve this issue, to preheat the car on the app so that the car is still plugged in and will be warm by the time you are ready to leave. This is not the most convenient thing to do when waking up. Another study done in 2020 found that “…a Tesla Model 3 lost over 60 miles of range after being driven with the seat warmers on and the heat on full blast” (Breda). Tesla has tried to counteract this issue of the battery losing driving range by insisting that people use the app to preheat their car while it is still plugged in, but again this is not the most effective use. People do not want to have to remember to preheat their car half an hour before they leave, and if they do not, their car will not drive properly. Tesla needs to improve the battery that is installed in every Tesla so that it is able to withstand colder temperatures; this can be accomplished if Tesla increases their budget for the research and development department. Within the research and development, they can find a solution to keeping the battery of a Tesla to withstand freezing temperatures by installing features to speed the heating process up and figure out a better solution than just preheating the car while it is plugged in.

    <h2><b>Door Handle Issues and Growing E.V. Competing Market</b></h2>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the issue of the door handles on Tesla’s not working properly in the winter, can push away possible customers from buying a Tesla as there are negative posts about the topic. Some solutions to fix the issue of the door handle with Tesla would be to either redesign the way in which the Tesla door handle opens or to create more options for the brand. Tesla is known to offer compact cars or SUV-size cars, but they mainly built their brand upon the idea that they are an all-electric car. This can hurt Tesla in the future as the market of electric vehicles is proliferating with other brands entering the market. Tesla needs to expand their options to include trucks, minivans, and sports cars. Again, this issue of the door handle is a weakness within the company as it gives the opportunity for outside companies to learn about Tesla’s flaws and build their models based on Tesla’s imperfections. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the new types of vehicles can change the design of the door handle to be more compatible with year-round weather. Tesla needs to be cautious of the constructive criticism that it receives and act quickly as the electric vehicle industry is growing quickly and becoming a red ocean rather than a blue ocean. As of right now, Tesla as a company has the most stake within the electrical vehicle industry but “…Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1” (Hailes). Although Tesla has fifty percent of the shares within the electric car industry, their percentage is decreasing due to new entrants entering the market. Tesla needs to act quickly about expanding their company and improving the internal issues that they have. If Tesla is unable to improve these issues and expand quickly, it will be competing at a disadvantage with other companies. Tesla has had the idea of a cybertruck but has yet to act upon this idea which could be harmful to them as a company because there is “…competition from Ford, Rivian and Chevrolet [that] will likely impact Tesla’s electric pickup volume potential” (Hailes). In order for Tesla to stay relevant within the electric car market, they need to act quickly on new innovations for their company, or else they will no longer be considered a star in the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix. Tesla can potentially fall down and be considered a question mark in the BCG Matrix if their shares continue to decline.

    <h2><b>Tesla Versus Selling Directly to Customers</b></h2>
    <p>
        Additionally, an issue that halts Tesla from selling their cars in other states would be the laws that are in place that stop Tesla from directly selling their cars to people as well as directly servicing the cars. The way in which you buy a car, you typically go into a car dealership and have to haggle with the salesperson. Most people, if they are able to choose, would not want to walk into a car dealership and have to haggle for a lower price as the price of the car is marked up. Traditionally this is the way in which people buy a car, Tesla on the other hand has skipped the middle man and has people buy directly from Tesla. “‘Beginning in 2014, the [car] dealers launched a state-by-state battle to block Tesla’s entry, arguing direct sales and service were prohibited by existing law’” (Weber). There are existing laws within certain states that prohibit the sales of direct buyers to sellers. This means that people cannot directly buy a car from Tesla online; they have to go to a dealership and buy a vehicle, but Tesla does not have their cars in dealerships.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the act of getting your car serviced you have to go to a mechanic but Tesla has serviced its own cars since they started their company. This takes out the use of separate mechanics working on Tesla as Tesla has made it so people can buy and get serviced directly from the company. Various states want to continue the use of car dealerships for the people who work there and for them not to lose their jobs. Today, many states have eased up on their laws against directly buying from Tesla but other states such as Texas continue to fight against Tesla. Texas has a Tesla factory but for someone to buy a Tesla in Texas the car has to be shipped out of Texas and then reimported into Texas. Tesla continues to fight against these laws as it wants to allow more people to own and use all-electric vehicles. In order for Tesla to be able to sell in these states, they have to persist in fighting these laws already in place within those states. This can take months and possibly years as Tesla is fighting against the legislative branch for states to change and alter the laws that are already in place. This issue of Tesla not being able to expand into other states is above their control as a company as it is within the laws of certain states. 
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2><b>Advancement in Charging Stations</b></h2>
    <p>
        Moreover, there is an issue with people owning a Tesla and wanting to drive it across the country or state. The issue is with the amount of charging stations or lack of charging stations. The state with the most charging stations is California as they have strategically placed them near highways and throughout the whole state. This makes California the most ideal state to have and own a Tesla in. The lack of various charging stations prevents people from taking road trips to other states. Tesla needs to make more charging stations off of various highways rather than just concentrating on one area. This will allow people to be open to having a Tesla because they are able to go cross country without having an issue of figuring out where the closest station is in comparison to their trip. Another issue that comes with owning a Tesla is the chance of the charging stations not working properly. An article states that “…more than half of all charging failures come from a station not being able to connect to its network for authentication” (Voelcker). This issue directly affects Tesla as they use charging stations to make sure that they have enough battery, but if the car cannot connect with the station it will not be able to charge. A way to improve this issue would be to allow for free wifi at charging stations so that the car can properly connect with the charging station and not have any issues. Another solution would be that if the charging station loses connection the charge is free. Tesla can install these into the system at their charging stations for their customers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, Tesla needs to work on designing their door handles and making their car more susceptible to cold weather. The cold weather affects the car battery, defrosting time, and the issue of opening the car. These issues are internal issues that can be solved by Tesla improving its models. Tesla also needs to quickly expand their options of vehicles as they are losing stake within the electric car market and if they want to continue to be a majority holder they need to revamp. Lastly, Tesla has to continue the fight against state laws to allow people to buy their product and to expand their amount of charging stations across the country. The improvements in the charging stations are internal issues that Tesla needs to improve upon so that they can retain their customer base without having people trade in a gas car or buy another electric car from a different company.
